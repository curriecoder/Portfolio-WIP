                    Born in Missouri and raised in Arizona, I have spent many of my adult years looking for my tribe, I feel I finally have found them in the field of progamming! My first time experiencing the joys (and headaches) of coding was when I was eleven years old. At that time my school was working with HTML 3.2, doing styling in-line. 
                    I continued playing around with HTML and CSS for many years and now I'm back at it with the LPS UPenn Coding Bootcamp! I served in the U.S. Army for five years straight out of high school, learning much about the world during that time. After that chapter had closed, I began searching for my next adventure in past passions.
                     I started self educating in C++ and evetually Python to see if it was an activity I still enjoyed. The excitment was still present with every new hurdle passed and knowledge gained.
                     I am thrilled to be a part of this challenging curriculum with the wonderful staff that is here to help transform me into a full-fledged web developer!
